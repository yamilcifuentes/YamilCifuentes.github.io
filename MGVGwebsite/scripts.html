    <h1>7 Reasons For Picking GTA 4 Revenge Mission</h1>
    <img src="pictures/7reasonsthumbnail.jpg" height="300">
    <p>GTA 4 is one of the best written GTA stories. It had really cool missions and lovable characters such as Roman and Little Jacob. But GTA 4 had 2 different endings called Revenge and Deal. Revenge is where you want to get your revenge on Dimitri for betraying you which leads to Kate’s death and Deal is where you accept the deal with Dimitri and Pegorino which leads to Roman’s death. I believe that you should get your revenge on Dimitri. Here are 10 reasons why, picking Revenge mission is better than picking deal. <br><br>Number 7,  Money isn’t everything- Yes, we all enjoy earning some GTA money when we complete a mission just so we can dick around with that money. But we didn’t buy GTA just to dick around with the money you earn, we play because we enjoy the storylines. If you pick to deal with Dimitri, do you feel like that’s more fun than entering a cargo ship to try to kill Dimitri. If you’re playing GTA just doing chores for other people, then play something else. I play to blow everything up in the digital world of Grand Theft Auto. You still would have enough money to go bowling. Just play the game for fun. <br><br> Number 6, Mallorie is pregnant- We all find out that Mallorie is pregnant after completing the entire game. It can told by Mallorie if you pick Deal or it can be told by Roman if you pick Revenge. Picking Revenge is a must because how can a baby grow up without a father, like come on. And it’s not like Roman would be a bad father. But it would be sad if that baby never gets to miss his dad. Even Roman said if it’s a girl, they will name it Kate. How touching. <br><br>Number 5,

    <h1>Niko Is Not Dead Script</h1>
    <img src="pictures/Niko%20Bellic%20is%20not%20dead%20thumbnail.jpg" height="300">
    <p>Hey everyone. I made a video talking about why you should pick the GTA 5 deathwish mission and I made a point that you shouldn’t kill off another GTA character because we already lost 2 such as Vic Vance and Johnny K. But I’m getting tons of comments saying that Niko is dead but I believe that that is not true. People are making this conclusion because of the Niko Bellic easter eggs in GTA 5. In this video, we’re going to take a look at every possible Niko Bellic easter eggs and see if Niko Belic is dead. Lester mentioned Eastern European so that must mostly be referring to Niko Belic and before you all say, “are you assuming his nationality,” it wouldn’t make sense if Rockstar just random said some guy without referring to a GTA character. Lester also said that Niko went quiet. Okay, that can mean a lot of things, it could mean that he’s dead, but we don’t know that because Lester wasn’t really specific on what he just said. Going quiet could also mean that Niko is laying low, he’s retired, left Liberty City probably to Vice City, or maybe started bowling full time. But we don’t what going quiet means, so we can’t end to conclusion that Niko is dead. <br><br> Next easter egg. The wanted posters. This one really confuses me because Niko Belic was a criminal in Liberty City but what’s his wanted posters doing in San Andreas? Is Niko Belic in San Andreas? Is Niko Belic in prison. Is Niko Belic dead? The wanted posters don’t really help the theory that he is dead, it just says he is wanted, maybe by the FIB or IAA, who the hell knows. But is  he wanted dead or alive? Idk, ask NoughtPointFourLive and he’ll explain it in a 15 to 20 minute video but let’s see another Niko Belic easter egg. Niko Belic Life Invader page. If you go to Michael’s safe house, you would see that Jimmy is stalking Niko Belic’s Life Invader page. But the question is why is Jimmy on Niko Belic’s Life Invader page? Does Jimmy have connection to Niko Belic? This easter egg could actually prove that Niko is alive because maybe Niko posted something and Jimmy is looking at what Niko posted. But there’s too many possibilities so we don’t know if this proves if he’s alive or dead, but I think he’s alive. <br><br>Next easter egg, Packie mentioning Niko. We all loved the GTA 4 heist we did and it was great when Packie mentioned it. But Packie said that Niko is probably dead. PROBABLY. PROB...BAB...LY. Packie is just assuming but don’t officially know the answer if he’s dead. Especially if Packie is living in San Andreas, he wouldn’t know to find out if Niko died. We can’t conclude Niko’s death on a probably. If Packie knows he’s dead, he would say. So this easter egg doesn’t help either. <br><br>Next easter In the GTA Online heist setup, Lester mentions Niko through the online character via phone. Now Lester pointed out a Bank robber in liberty city a decade ago. This may be referring to Niko but there can be many bank robbers in Liberty City. And Lester said like over a decade ago, GTA 4 takes time in 2008 and GTA 5 takes time 2013 and the timeline is 5 years apart so I’m assuming that Lester was not referring to Niko since Niko wasn’t even in Liberty City 10 years before 2013. You may argue that Lester got the number wrong but there’s no evidence if it’s even Niko to begin with. You may also argue that GTA Online is currently in the present year but GTA Online takes time before GTA 5 story mode. Whatever happened to him, he disappeared, whoever this bank robber is. Last easter egg I’ll use and I think this is a big one. I won’t be using the Karen or Michelle, or whatever the hell she likes to be called easter eggs because she may be a character in GTA 4 but it wouldn’t really help our theory. There is a frame photo of Niko Bellic in a bar in Blain County. Is it really Niko Bellic? Would there be a reason for why there will be a framed photo of Niko in Blaine County if he’s from Liberty City. Well there’s this clip of Roman wanting to own a bar. Did Niko want to own a bar? Let’s say he did, let’s say he did move to blaine county to start a bar with or without Roman, and I say that because Roman’s life is actually determined in GTA 4 if you make a decision to make a deal with Jimmy and Dimitri or get your revenge with Dimitri , if you choose deal, Roman dies and if you choose revenge, Kate dies but who cares about Kate, bowling for life. So this is Niko’s bar and some say that Niko was killed in this bar because there are interesting bloody handprints and footprints looking like whoever came through this door shot whoever was standing behind the counter and was trying to escape judging by the bloody handprints and footprints. People say that the man behind the counter is Niko, but here’s the problem. How do we really know it’s Niko if we didn’t see it on screen. Just know if we don’t see what occured on screen, we cannot create a conclusion until we really know, we know nothing, like come on. Theories are theories but not exact. Another thing people say is that Trevor killed Niko. How do we know it’s Trevor, we don’t know. Oh because Trevor just like to kill inside bars for no reason. Not on screens, don’t draw conclusions. And could this also be Niko’s coat? Probably a coincidence but there’s still a missing gap. <br><br>In conclusion, is Niko dead or alive. I say no, because according to my evidence, I stated that Lester wasn’t clear what going quiet means because that can mean anything. I stated that Packie said that Niko was probably dead which means he doesn’t really know if he is dead or not because he said probably. And Lester mentioned some facts that could probably or not lead to Niko Bellic due to not enough facts and some facts seemed to be invalid. The other Niko Bellic easter eggs I mentioned doesn’t point to any leads to Niko’s status, we were analyzing every possible Niko Bellic easter eggs together. So that’s it for this video, Niko is not dead. If Niko did died, I’m pretty sure Rockstar would have showed us because maybe Rockstar Games would want to reuse Niko Belic in the future. If i miss some Niko Bellic easter eggs and some facts, let me know in the comment section below.
