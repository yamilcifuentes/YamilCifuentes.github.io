            On April 11th, 2015, I started a YouTube called MGVG (Mad Guy Video Gamer). My goal for this channel was to create content. I started this channel by making both gaming and wrestling videos when it was called MGVG Wrestling and Gaming. Although that had to be change when gaming videos were being more watched than the wrestling videos and people were unsubscribing when they weren't watching content they didn't like. So I decided to unlink the wrestling videos and renamed my channel to MGVG entertainment. My goal for the MGVG channel is create amazing content that people can watch and enjoy.

            I used a lot of programs ever since I started video editing. I would always used free software because I didn't had these high end programs due to my lack of money. I would always create cheaply edited videos using <b>Windows Movie Maker</b>. I couldn't really do much with this editor becuase all you get to do is cut videos together. A frienof mines recommened I used <b>Adobe Premiere Pro</b>, but when I saw the price, I was like hell no. Although I was curious and I did wanted to try the program out for myself so I started the 30 day trial. Within those 30 days, I manage to understand Premiere a lot better, I would watch tutorials just for fun. The price for Premiere Pro is <b>$30/months</b>, but you can pay for the creative cloude where you can get all of the adobe programs for just<b>$50/month</b>, or <b>$20/month</b> if you're a student. I still don't pay that because I am very cheap. But what I used to edit my videos is a similar program made by Adobe called <b>Adobe Premiere Elements</b>. Even though it doesn't really have everything the pro does, the element does have everything I need to edit my videos. Adobe Premiere elements have a stand alone price of <b>$100</b>.
