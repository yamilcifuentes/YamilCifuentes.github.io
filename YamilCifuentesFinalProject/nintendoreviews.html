          <p class="author"> I loved <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Nintendo" target="_blank">Nintendo</a> all my life. Everytime I couldn't get a violent video game, my mom would always get me a Mario game and it worked. I grew up playing Mario, <a href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Main_Page" target="_blank"> Zelda </a> and <a href="http://kirby.wikia.com/wiki/Kirby" target="_blank">Kirby</a>. I remember asking my dad for a <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Nintendo_GameCube" target="_blank">Gamecube</a> for he actually got one for me. That was 15 years ago and I couldn't be anymore happier. Right now I am playing 3DS and Nintendo Switch and I am having a blast with them. I can't wait for Super Smash Bros for the Switch.  </p>

  <h2>Luigi's Mansion</h2>

            </div>
  <p class="author"> Nintendo has always had a dark side. Though it's built up a name for itself as a family-friendly game company, every so often, when it can be contained no longer, its dark side manifests itself in the form of a Super Metroid or a Majora's Mask. But while we expect a touch of gloom and misery in our Zeldas and Metroids, it may strike you as more than a bit curious that one of Nintendo's darkest adventures stars a platforming hero who had previously been known for some of the happiest, most family-friendly games on earth.

      But then, nearly every aspect of <a href="http://luigi-mansion.wikia.com/wiki/Luigi%27s_Mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> is bound to strike many as more than a bit curious. Nintendo had launched each of its three previous consoles with a bright and colourful Mario platformer, yet for the GameCube, the company chose a dark, atmospheric title starring the mascot's lesser-known brother. Not only that, but Luigi's Mansion was about as far from a traditional Mario game as it could possibly get – so much so that it didn't even feature a jump button.

Perhaps it's for these reasons that Luigi's Mansion never got the recognition for which Nintendo had hoped. It simply wasn't the game that people were expecting. It's a shame, really, because in actuality it's quite a remarkable little title. Luigi's Mansion is a unique and atmospheric experience that's as fun as it is technologically impressive.

The premise is a simple one: Luigi has won a mansion in a contest... except he doesn't remember entering any contest. To see what the deal is, he heads out to check out the mansion for himself. Once inside, he is almost immediately confronted by a gang of disgruntled ghosts; thankfully, the notorious Professor E. Gadd (creator of such classic commodities as F.L.U.D.D. and the Portraitificationizer) comes to your aid with one of his latest inventions. He explains to Luigi that his brother, Mario, is being held captive inside of the mansion. Naturally, Luigi must find a way to save him.   </p>
     	
        	<h3>Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga</h3>
      <img src="images/superstarsaga.PNG" >
      <p class="author">Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga is an action RPG that takes the brothers Mario on an original adventure on the Game Boy Advance. The polished game marks the third foray the Mario franchise has taken into the RPG genre. The first, Super Mario RPG for the Super Nintendo, is a classic gem born out of Nintendo's collaboration with Squaresoft, while the second, Paper Mario for the <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Nintendo_64" target="_blank">Nintendo 64</a>, was developed by Intelligent Systems. This latest entry in the genre, developed by Alpha Dream, is a fun and engaging spin on the traditional action RPG experience that blends equal doses of impressive technology, innovation, and humor. The end result, like its Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 predecessors, winds up offering a fun, engaging experience that should not be missed. Simply put, it's one of the best GBA games ever.The gameplay in Mario and Luigi is, at its core, an action RPG in the same vein as the classic Super Mario RPG for the Super Nintendo and Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64. You'll roam the whole of the Beanbean Kingdom in your attempt to thwart Cackletta's evil plan. You'll face various enemies in turn-based combat, you'll solve puzzles, and you'll navigate through dungeonlike environments. While Mario and Luigi may sound like just another action RPG, the game's two-character mechanic offers a unique gameplay experience that is extremely fresh. You'll even come across sequences that recall the barrel- and platform-jumping seen in previous Mario games folded into the appealing mix. </p>

          <h4>Super Smash Bros</h4>
          <img src="images/smash.jpg" height="400" width="490">
          
          <p class="author">I never thought <a href="http://supersmashbros.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._series" target="_blank">Smash Bros</a>.’ intense four-player multiplayer battles needed more fighters, but eight-player brawls have become one of my favorite modes in Super Smash Bros. for <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Wii_U" target="_blank">Wii U</a>. Eight-player battles are local-only,  which is an unfortunate limitation, but if you get a group of friends together you’ll fill these big, vibrantly colorful arenas with sheer madness happening in every corner. Each character displays fantastic personality in combat, drawing on a rich history from dozens of different beloved games. As I strike, dodge, block, and weave through seven other fighters, a match builds up to a climax that’s genuinely fun, each and every time. That represents Super Smash Bros. for Wii U as a whole: it’s bigger than ever, but remains laser-focused on the finely balanced action that makes this a legendary fighting game series.</p>
