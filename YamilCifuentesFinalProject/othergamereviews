  <p> It started way back in 2002 when I saw how cool the Gameboy Advance was when I saw my cousins playing with them. Since there was no smart phones at the time and there was not really nothing much to do, I told my parents that I wanted a Gameboy to keep me occupied. Soon, I got my very own Gameboy to put in my pocket. It even came with my first Gameboy game ever, Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga... which was a really fun game to play with. I soon got my second game, which was Wario Land 4 which was really frustrating because boss levels were so fricking hard.    </p>
  
 
  <p> After the Gameboy was a really interesting time because the PlayStation 2 was really hot at the time and my older brother got rated M games especially a popular title called Grand Theft Auto Vice City. My bolder brother forbid me to play these games but there was no way I'm gonna listen. When he's not home, I would use the spare memory card and play some Grand Theft Auto. Even though I couldn't really read at the time and I didn't really know where to go, a majority of the time I would make the player just kill civilians for no reason and steal cars. As a got older, I started understanding the game a little better so I managed to commplete the game in the future. Those were fun times and thankfully playing M rated games didn't messed me up as a child.
