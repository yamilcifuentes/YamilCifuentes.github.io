  <p class="author"> It started way back in 2002 when I saw how cool the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP" target="_blank"> Gameboy Advance </a> was when I saw my cousins playing with them. Since there was no smart phones at the time and there was not really nothing much to do, I told my parents that I wanted a Gameboy to keep me occupied. Soon, I got my very own Gameboy to put in my pocket. It even came with my first Gameboy game ever, <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_%26_Luigi:_Superstar_Saga" target="_blank"> Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga... </a> which was a really fun game to play with. I soon got my second game, which was Wario Land 4 which was really frustrating because boss levels were so fricking hard.    </p>
  
 
          <p class="author"> After the Gameboy was a really interesting time because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2" target="_blank"> PlayStation 2 </a> was really hot at the time and my older brother got rated M games especially a popular title called <a href="http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto Vice City </a>. My bolder brother forbid me to play these games but there was no way I'm gonna listen. When he's not home, I would use the spare memory card and play some Grand Theft Auto. Even though I couldn't really read at the time and I didn't really know where to go, a majority of the time I would make the player just kill civilians for no reason and steal cars. As a got older, I started understanding the game a little better so I managed to commplete the game in the future. Those were fun times and thankfully playing M rated games didn't messed me up as a child. 
     	

          <p class="author"> I soon got into better handhelds like the <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Nintendo_DS" target="blank"> DS </a>. I really liked how a device had duel screens and it was probably the ifrst device to have touch screen. And I also got into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable" target="_blank"> PSP </a> and I gotta say that the PSP was awesome because I played so manycool games such as <a href="http://jakanddaxter.wikia.com/wiki/Daxter" target="_blank"> Daxter </a>. I only iwshed that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Vita" target="_blank"> PSP Vita </a> had a great run like the PSP. When the DS became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS" target="_blank"> 3DS </a>, that was a real game changer because it runs some of the best games and the 3DS is still alive up to this day. Now I play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4" target="_blank"> PS4 </a> and I'm excited for the next games that are coming out. I will be talking about some of the best games I played. </p>
